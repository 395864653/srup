# SRUP

## Secure Remote Update Protocol
The Secure Remote Update Protocol (SRUP) is a secure & confirmable command-and-control (C2) protocol for the Internet of Things (IoT), based on MQTT.

SRUP is designed to provide an easy way to communicate details of a required software update to an IoT device – but it's not limited just software updates; the protocol can be extended to support any type of C2 message.

### Where is the source code?
The source code isn't quite ready for release yet – but once it is, it will be added to this repository.

In the meantime if you require access to a copy then please email: [ajpoulter@dstl.gov.uk](mailto:ajpoulter@dstl.gov.uk?subject=Access to SRUP Source Code)
