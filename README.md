# SRUP

## Secure Remote Update Protocol
The Secure Remote Update Protocol (SRUP) is a secure & confirmable command-and-control (C2) protocol for the Internet of Things (IoT), based on MQTT.

SRUP is designed to provide an easy way to communicate details of a required software update to an IoT device â€“ but it's not limited just software updates; the protocol can be extended to support any type of C2 message.

Further details of the protocol may be found in the paper "SRUP: The Secure Remote Update Protocol" to be published at the IEEE World Forum on the Internet of Things, 12th December 2016. This page will be updated to include a URL where the paper can be accessed as soon as it is available.
